# SetOdpNetRefVer
Simple hacking tool to modify .NET assembly binary directly to change the version number of referenced ODP.NET.

This hacking tool can find the version number bytes of referenced Orace.DataAccess.dll in the .NET assembly binary and change them to a new version number. It saves time to change reference version and recompile, but doesn't guarantee version compatibility. Use it as your own risk.
